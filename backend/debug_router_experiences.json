    "Use flowchart with subgraphs for modular components, directional arrows for relationships, and class definitions for styling.",
    "Use flowchart with subgraphs and custom styling to represent hierarchical components and processes",
    "Use graph TB with subgraphs and custom styling classes to visualize hierarchical phases and component relationships.",
    "Use flowchart with subgraphs to represent configuration, execution initiation, and building processes, including nested subgraphs for phases and roles, with directional annotations and descriptive labels.",
    "Used a Top-Down (TB) flowchart to illustrate hierarchical relationships and data flow between components. Subgraphs group related elements (Tools and Core Components) for clarity, and styling (colors, borders) visually distinguishes different sections (MCP Server, Tools, Core Components) to enhance readability and emphasize structure.",
    "Use flowchart with subgraphs and class definitions to visualize phases, agents, outputs, configurations, and decisions, applying distinct styling for each component.",
    "Used a directed graph (graph TD) to illustrate the sequential flow of data and key components in a trading system, with subgraphs to group related elements (e.g., main components and data flow) for clarity and organization.",
    "Used ClassDiagram to model entities and relationships, showing UserTable as main class with attributes and Preferences as a separate class linked via composition to illustrate data structure and associations clearly.",
    "Used a flowchart (graph TD) to visualize hierarchical relationships between directories and files, with top-down layout for clear parent-child dependencies, using nodes for folders and arrows to indicate containment or organization.",
    "Used a top-to-bottom flowchart (graph TB) to visualize the hierarchical and directional flow of components, including external services, frontend, backend services, databases, and monitoring. Layout organizes services logically with subgraphs for grouping, and styling with distinct colors enhances readability by categorizing components (e.g., frontend, backend, external). Key features include clear directional arrows for API calls, service-to-service communication, and monitoring connections to illustrate data flow and dependencies."
